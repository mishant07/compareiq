# Webcmd Browser through MCP

Use `webcmd_cli_run` for a live browser task. Put browser session selectors before the browser command.

## Session lifecycle

Create one named Session, use its returned readable ID on each bounded browser
action, and close it when finished. IDs are immutable and Profile-scoped. Raw
browser commands require an explicit readable selector. Each invocation has a
240-second wall-clock budget.

With SLAB, `session list` includes unbound live windows as `discovered` rows and
`browser tabs` lists their pages without claiming them. Bind an exact returned
page with `browser bind --page <page-id>`; this claims its complete window.
Discovered IDs expire when the browser attachment or daemon restarts, so list
again after a stale-ID failure. Closing an adopted human Session detaches Webcmd
and leaves the human window open.

    { "argv": ["--profile", "work", "session", "create", "Work Project", "-f", "json"] }
    { "argv": ["--profile", "work", "--session", "work-project-k7", "browser", "tabs", "-f", "json"] }
    { "argv": ["--profile", "work", "--session", "work-project-k7", "browser", "bind", "--page", "page-123", "-f", "json"] }
    { "argv": ["--profile", "work", "--session", "work-project-k7", "browser", "snapshot", "--snapshot-mode", "act", "-f", "json"] }
    { "argv": ["--profile", "work", "session", "close", "work-project-k7"] }

Take a fresh snapshot after navigation, submits, SPA transitions, login, or a
human handoff. Prefer semantic locators and scoped extraction. Return compact
evidence: URL, title, selected text, response URL/status/sample, or specific
fields, never an unbounded DOM dump. Do not complete a payment or checkout
without explicit user confirmation.

## Browser programs and artifacts

Put a browser program in an attached virtual file and invoke it with argv:

    {
      "argv": ["--profile", "work", "--session", "work-project-k7", "browser", "run", "--file", "probe.js", "-f", "json"],
      "files": [{ "path": "probe.js", "content": "await page.goto('https://example.com'); return { url: page.url(), title: await page.title() };", "encoding": "utf8" }]
    }

Keep dependent waits, clicks, fills, and response listeners in one program. Arm
a response listener before the UI action that triggers it.

Screenshots and large snapshots are artifacts, not local files. Retrieve a
returned artifact id through:

    { "argv": ["artifacts", "get", "ea_0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"] }

For a login wall or CAPTCHA, stop automation and keep the live-view handoff.
Give the user the returned view URL, wait, then run the returned verifier and
take a fresh snapshot before resuming. `action_required` is a hard stop.
